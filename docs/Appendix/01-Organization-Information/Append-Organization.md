### Communication Procedures

* Texting was the agreed upon way to communicate with one another, and if un able to reach a phone call or email will be done.
* A response to any texts that require it are expected within a 3-4 hours of the text being sent.
* Elisabeth Sabbagh will be the point of contact for instructor correspondence. The lead will send and recieve any information provided by the instructor. This will be communicated with the group either in or a combination of group text chat, email and scheduled weekly meetings.

### Meeting Schedule and Coordiation

* Team will meet in class as well as when the group agrees we all need to meet for an assignment. This will be either during the week or weekend as well. If any team member is unable to make it, we will relay the information.
* It with be a virtual type of meeting and if urgent will be face to face.
* Reminders for the meetings will be by text message and verbally during class times.
* Changes to this schedule will be discussed first before finalized and then put out via a text message to the group text chat.
* Outside of agreed upon meeting times we will always talk in class about where everyone is at with their parts of any assignment and adjust if needed.

### Team Coordination & Accountability

* Assignments are submitted by the day it is due. If needed, the team will discuss if late policy is needed which is dependent on assingment and how the team feels.
* To Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required, the team will work with one another to help achieve the end goal. The team can meet before the course starts, office hours and other various available time to recieve additional support from other members or higher ups (Professors/TAs).
* Feedback is to be acted on throughout the course time (immediately when received), ensuring the documentation is updated based on what feedback was given for improvement. 
* Missed contributions/assignments/actions will be talked to with the individual as a team and seeing if they need additional support to ensure its completion and satisfactory. 
* Team will keep each other updated about their projects and talk if there is arising issues
* When a team member is underperforming; rather than cold-shouldering them, the team will talk and take the necessary actions to help the individual.
* The main consequence of no further improvements with underperformance is pink slip.

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

For conflicts, we will first discuss within the group to see if there is a solution we can make happen. If the issue is unable to be solved, we will then make a meeting with a professor to see if a solution is possible that way instead.
